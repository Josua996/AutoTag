# 🤷🏼‍♂️ What is Auto Tag?
_Auto Tag_ is a Thunderbird addon that allows you to automatically assign tags to incoming emails. You can assign tags to individual e-mail addresses. After the tags are selected, they will be assigned to all new incoming mails from this sender.  
You can download the addon directly from the Mozilla website: _Comming Soon®_

# 👨🏼‍🏫 How does it work?

**Add new Tags:**  
Adding tags to a mail address is easy as pie. Just press the auto-tag icon above your message. In the popup that appears, you can select the tags you want. Starting from the next message, the selected tags will be assigned to emails from this sender.

</p>

**Delete and modify Tags in Settings:**  
In the addon settings _(Thunderbird->Preferences->Addons and Themes->Extentions)_ you can also edit the automatic tag assignments. Here you can edit and delete the assignments.

</p>

**Tag-Quickselect-Toolbar (Beta):**  
The toolbar can be activated in the addon settings. With it you can quickly add new tags to a mail with one click. This function is still quite basic and I will possibly optimize it further in the future and publish it in a separate addon.

<p><b>🗣 Do you speak an unsupported language?</b> In the <i>src/_locales</i> folder you will find the translations in different languages. You can simply create a new file here, e.g. <i>src/_locales/fr/messages.json</i> for French. If you can't or don't want to upload the file to GitHub you can send it to me by mail.</p>

<p><b>♻️ Refactor:</b> There is certainly a lot of potential to improve the code, whether commenting, performance, or bugs. Feel free to also make bigger changes to the code.</p>
<p><b>🎉 New Features:</b> If you have an idea to implement a new feature, feel free to create a pull request. If I can help you with the implementation - let me know! If you want to help but don't know what, here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The ability to add new entries in the addon settings</li>
	<li>Improve the <i>Tag Quickselect Toolbar</i></li>
	<li>A function to export and import the current configuration</li>
	<li>The addon could be much more dynamic and more customizable via the settings</li>
	<li>If no configurations are saved, a guide/message should be displayed in the settings</li>
</ul>
